### About Safety for Agentic AI

As enterprises explore open models to accelerate agentic workflows, a critical challenge emerges where total end-to-end safety isn't warranted.
Open models offer flexibility, but they pose unknown risks with content safety, security, and privacy risks when used out of the box.
As regulations tighten across regions and industries, non-compliance isn't just costly, it can be catastrophic.
CISOs, compliance leaders, and policymakers are increasingly concerned with unaligned model behavior, ranging from toxic outputs and jailbreak risks to leakage of sensitive or regulated data.
MLOps teams, lacking proactive safety tooling, are forced to patch issues reactively in production.

NVIDIA Safety for Agentic AI offers a structured recipe to evaluate and align open models early, enabling increased safety, security, and compliant agentic workflows.
Start with model evaluation using Garak vulnerability scanning with curated risk prompts, benchmarking against enterprise thresholds.
Afterward, post-train using recipes and safety datasets to close critical safety and security gaps.
Deploy the hardened model as a trusted universal NIM and then add inference-time safety protection with [NVIDIA NeMo Guardrails](https://developer.nvidia.com/nemo-guardrails/) that actively block unsafe behavior.
With continuous monitoring, auditability, and collaboration between AI and risk teams, model safety becomes enforceable, not aspirational.
With Safety for Agentic AI, enterprises can now confidently adopt open models, aligned to their policy, and protected from model adoption, deployment, and inference runtime at production.

For guidelines and suggestions about the process, refer to [Best Practices for Developing a Model Behavior Guide](./docs/best-practices-model-behavior-guide.md).

This repository is what powers the [build experience](https://build.nvidia.com/nvidia/safety-for-agentic-ai), helping you harden security at every stage of the AI development lifecycle.

### Architecture

NVIDIA Safety for Agentic AI is broken down into four steps, which map to a typical agentic workflow environment:

- Safety, security and accuracy evaluation of any model.
- Post-training with NVIDIA curated datasets.
- Deploying a trusted model as a universal NIM.
- Running a trusted model with NVIDIA NeMo Guardrails for run-time guardrails.
